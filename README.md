# stave2number

## Overview

It's a tool to add the numbered musical notation to staves.

## motivation
    
While attending  music classes in both elementary and junior high schools, or being members of a straight flute ensemble, our teachers would often ask us to notate numbered musical notation onto the stave if we were not able to read traditional sheet music fluently.

Although the notation process could be a good practice for sight-reading, it is actually troublesome and unnecessary since our main goal is to play the music instead of sight-reading.

We hope that there could be a numbered musical notation generator so as to accomplish this task.

## Environment

- Python 3.10.4
- opencv-python 4.6.0.66
- numpy 1.22.4
- pickleshare 0.7.5
- matplotlib 3.5.2

## Usage

- Input
  - A stave generated by [MuseCore](https://musescore.org/zh-hant) and save to image file
  - Set the variables in stave2num.py
    - line 16: set the for-range to the number of lines in the stave
    - line 39: set the input_file to the filename of your input image
- Output
  - You can find the notated stave in the result folder
